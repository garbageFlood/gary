			<p class = "paragraphs2">Welcome to the Disability Support page of the Student Portal.
									I am Karen Mooney the Disability Officer and this page is here
									to ensure you are getting all the information you need about 
									the Learning and Disability Support Service in NCI.  
									My role is to support any student in NCI who has a disability, 
									learning difficulty, mental health condition or significant on going illness.<br/><br/>
									I believe the most important first step is to make sure that you
									can access supports in an open relaxed, friendly and confidential way.<br/><br/>
									The Third Level supports that are available here in NCI are funded
									by the Irish Government and part funded by the European Social Fund
									under the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007 â€“ 2013.
